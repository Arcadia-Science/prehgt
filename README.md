preHGT a pipeline for lightweight, automated, and scalable approach for pre-screening genomes across the tree of life for horizontal gene transfer (HGT).

The preHGT pipeline wraps existing parametric and implicit phylogenetic methods for HGT detection and reports multiple metrics about input genome contamination. 
It quickly produces a "good-enough" candidate list of genes that researchers can further investigate with more stringent HGT detection methods, different data modalities, or wet lab experimentation.

TODO: add pipeline overview DAG/figure.

The preHGT pipeline combines compositional scans, pangenome inference, and BLAST-based searches. 
For the interpretation of the BLAST results, we took advantage of a rich literature of BLAST-based HGT predictor indices and re-implemented many with the goal of providing the most information possible from one BLAST run with a single tool.
To reduce overall run times, the pipeline employs clustering heuristics, including construction of a genus-level pangenome to reduce query size and searches against a clustered database to reduce database size.
To reduce false positives, we included multiple screens for contamination based on similarity to database matches, position of gene in the contiguous sequence, and homolog presence in closely related genomes.

We're not picky about capitalization; choose whatever feels right to you (prehgt, preHGT) and feel free to capitalizate at the beginning of a sentence if it brings you joy (PreHGT).

| **genus**                                        | input      | the input genus for a given HGT candidate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **hgt_candidate**                                | pangenome  | HGT candidate gene sequence name. The name is derived from the original FASTA CDS from genomic file downloaded from NCBI and contains the chromosome name, gene number, and GenBank protein ID if it exists. This is also the BLAST query sequence ID.                                             |
| **method**                                       | NA         | the method used to infer the HGT candidate. Currently blast, raau (relative amino acid usage), or both                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **RAAU_cluster**                                 | RAAU       | the cluster that an HGT candidate was in. If multiple HGT candidates are reported for the RAAU method, the cluster might indicate if genes have a similar RAAU (which may indicate shared donor or evolutionary history).                                                                          |
| **blast_algorithm_type**                         | blast      | the BLAST algorithm type used to infer the HGT candidate. One of eith kingdom or sub-kingdom.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **blast_HGT_score**                              | blast      | HGT score inferred from Alien Index. Also reports contamination liklihood. Since Alien index is only calculated for kingdom level transfers, the score will be NA for all sub-kingdom algorithm type results.                                                                                      |
| **blast_hgt_taxonomy_level**                     | blast      | the taxonomic level at which the HGT event was detected (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family)                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **blast_acceptor_lca_level**                     | blast      | within the acceptor group, what level of taxonomy does the lowest common ancestor occur among all matches? If it’s at the phylum level, the HGT event is probably older than if it’s at the genus level. Or, if the HGT is only observed in two phyla, perhaps the HGT happened twice.             |
| **blast_acceptor_max_pident**                    | blast      | excluding self matches, the maximum percent identity of matches within the acceptor group.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
